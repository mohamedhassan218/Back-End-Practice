# Back-end Practice

- In this repo, I'll share all steps including learning some tools, with resources, and interview questions during my journey to be a Back-end Engineer.

    - ## Learning JavaScript
        - Here, I code the basics of JavaScript and implement small projects.
        - You can learn js from this insightful book → [`TextBook`](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html).
    - ## Learning Express
        - There, I code my first projects using express framework.
        - I used this playlist to understand the main 
        flow of the express project → [`Playlist`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_cUvD4qzbkwp6pxx27pqgohrsP8v1Wj2).
        - If you want to upgrade your level to learn advanced topics, you can see this document → [`Doc`](https://devdocs.io/express/)
        - This folder also contains the REST API best practices with examples in express.
    - ## Learning Prisma
        - Prisma is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) and it also support to work with MongoDb (NoSQL).
        - To implement the code in this directory I've used this [`doc`](https://www.prisma.io/) and a [`vid`](https://youtu.be/RebA5J-rlwg?si=cxaplZMDG6DGgv6G).
